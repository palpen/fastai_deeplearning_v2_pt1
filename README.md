Notes and projects while taking FastAI's Deep Learning Course Part 1

- Must make the fastai repository the main folder when using it for personal projects. Cannot have the following directory structure:
    
    fastai
    data
    experiments

where fastai is the repository. Try this approach at home !!!

Things you need
- resnet weights (what is the link)
- Datasets (in data folder)

Folders:
1. fastai repository
2. Within the fastai repository under courses, personal notes and projects have \_Palermo\_lessunNUM suffix
3.
